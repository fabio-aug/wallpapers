## ðŸ“ƒ About

Repository for my hand-picked collection of wallpapers for personal and daily use. My goal is to gradually replace all images with my own creations.

## ðŸ”§ Script

The repository has a very simple python3 script to provisionally rename files en masse. To run it successfully just edit line 3 by pasting the address of the image folder.

## ðŸ“Œ Credits

All images were found on the following websites:
